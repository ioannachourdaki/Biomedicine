# Biomedicine Technology Lab: Big Data in Health 
This repository is for the Biomedicine Technology Lab. It contains the project developed as part of the course curriculum.

## Description
Perform statistical data analysis using **R**. This analysis is on R-dataset `wellbeing` which contains the following variables:
1. Country
2. Well-being index of each country (Well.being)
3. Gross Domestic Product in dollars (GDP)
4. Equality
5. Food consumption (Food.consumption)
6. Alcohol consumption (Alcohol.consumption)
7. Energy consumption (Energy.consumption)
8. Fertility: number of children / woman (Family)
9. Working hours (Working.hours)
10. Labor income in dollars (Work.income)
11. Health care expenditure: % of Government expenditure (Health.spending)
12. Military spending: % of GDP (Military.spending)

## Statistics
The provided code:
1. Calculates the mean value of **Health.spending** for all European countries in the dataset
2. Finds the European country with the highest value of **Health.spending**
3. Finds the first 3 European countries with the highest **Health.spending** score
4. Graphs Well.being variable of the European countries as a function of the **Health.spending**
5. Finds the European countries which have a **Health.spending** value greater than the mean of the **Health.spending** of 22 countries and graphs
their Well.being variable values
